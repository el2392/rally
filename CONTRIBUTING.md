Team Norms:
=============
The idea of this project is learn and understand the advantages and challenges of working in collaborative environment along with enhancing skillset. Therefore it would be great if everybody involved can follow these general principles to create a learning and an inclusive environment.

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, the essence of collaboration
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the mutual end goal

**Definition of "done":**
- The tasks are supposed to be made very specifically, so when the task is complete we will consider it done
- All code for each User Story must be peer-reviewed and pass automated tests before merging into the trunk

**Sprint cadence:**
- Sprint should take about one to two weeks

**Scrum Meeting Times:**
- Will last roughly 10 minutes
- Meet in person: 5:30PM on Mondays, 1:45PM on Tuesdays and Thursdays after class
- Meet over Slack: 12:30PM on Saturdays

**What to do when a member is failing to deliver on their obligations to the team:** 
- Product Manager should reach out to the failing individual and ask about the circumstances, followed by kindly giving them a push to complete the task
- If the member does not get the task required done by the time the sprint is over, we must report to the professor and deal with the situation appropriately.

**How quickly team members are expected to respond to messages directed at them:**
- Within 24 hours via Slack

**Rules for prioritizing the Product Backlog:**
- Product Backlog is managed by the Product Owner, but with Developer involvement and feedback 
- The more valuable the outcome of the story, the higher it is in the backlog 
- In each sprint the team tries to complete stories from the top of the Backlog, although stories from further down the backlog may be added to a sprint to come up with a level of effort that is achievable

### **Git Workflow:**
Every developer should follow the standard procedures of working in a decentralized environment. One person will be tasked in the team to manage the master branch and make sure there are no conflicts between branches. We will be using trunk based workflow.

### **Contribution:**
If you would like to contribute to this project, either by providing feature requests, reporting potential bugs, etc. we will be very happy to take an input from you. Please do so by using the issues, emailing anyone of the team members or directly reaching out in class. Thank you in advance for doing so.
