RALLY
=====

### **About the project:**
As a college student in New York City and as a native New Yorker who is always on the move, I have quite often found it difficult to organize group hangouts. My friends seem to never be available at the same times as me. When we finally decide on a time, knowing what to do or picking the place to go eat/socialize/simply meet up is even more difficult. Many people that I have interviewed, especially those who are in or from NYC, can also attest to this problem. For this reason, this semester, I would like to work on creating a mobile app where users can easily "rally" their friends together when meeting as a group and plan things in an organized manner.
